DV = Numeric & Not fluctuating like an ECG = Regression problem = Linear Regression, RandomForest Regressor, SVM Regressor, XGBoost Regressor etc.

DV = Numeric & fluctuating like an ECG = Time Series Problem = VAR, ARIMA, GARIMA, SARIMA (all weak and outdated except Finance Industry) = New Trend with Neural Networks (LSTMs)

DV = Categorical (<=5 classes in DV) = Classification Problem = Logistic Regression (Binary or Multinomial), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, CART, LDA, Latent Dirichlet Allocation etc.

>5 classes in DV = at least 4K rows of each class


=====================Deep Learning=========================

Images = CNN, GAN

Text & Numbers = LSTM, RNN

Creation of images, music = Autoencoders and RBMs

Recommender Systems (Netflix) = Neural Networks
